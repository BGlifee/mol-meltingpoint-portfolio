#  Molecular Melting Point Prediction
A fully reproducible, production-style machine learning pipeline for predicting molecular melting points using engineered chemical descriptors and tabular feature reduction techniques.

##  Overview
This project focuses on building a scalable and maintainable ML workflow rather than just achieving a single leaderboard score.  
It demonstrates how I:
- design end-to-end pipelines
- manage experiments systematically
- think about performance, reproducibility, and collaboration

##  Technologies I Used
- **Python** (core language)
- **Pandas, NumPy** – data processing
- **Scikit-learn** – modeling, evaluation, pipelines
- **XGBoost, LightGBM** – boosting models
- **RDKit** – chemistry feature generation
- **SciPy / Sparse Matrices** – efficient memory handling
- **Joblib** – model persistence
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – visualization
- **VSCode + Conda Environment** – development environment
